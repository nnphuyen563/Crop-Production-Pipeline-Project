## Introduction

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into global crop production statistics sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). By ingesting data from <a href = "https://data.world/agriculture/crop-production">Data World</a> and generating <a href = "https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f62e4703-b18e-491c-97f5-c34551975fa4">Crop Production Dashboard</a>, the project will strive to enhance understanding and facilitate informed decision-making. <br>

This could help answer questions:
<ol>
    <li>What are the top 5 crop items produced in each continent in terms of quantity over the years?</li>
    <li>How does the proportion of crop production vary across category?</li>
    <li>What is the geographical distribution of specific crop categories across different areas?</li>
</ol>
